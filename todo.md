# Todo List: Dashboard Layout Project

## Step 1: Set up and Planning
- [X] Set up a Git repository for the project.
- [ ] Set up HTML and CSS files with some dummy content to ensure everything is linked correctly.
- [X] Download a full-resolution copy of the project design file.
- [ ] Review the design file to understand the layout structure.

## Step 2: Layout
- [ ] Write the HTML structure for the sidebar, header, and main-content containers.
- [ ] Apply Grid properties in CSS to create a basic layout with the grid system.

## Step 3: Nesting
- [ ] Begin nesting child elements under their respective parent elements in the HTML.
- [ ] In the sidebar, create nested grids for the navigation and branding sections.
- [ ] In the header, create nested grids for the search bar, user info, and buttons.
- [ ] In the main-content, create nested grids for the projects, announcements, and trending items.
- [ ] Add dummy content and placeholder images to position grid items.

## Step 4: Gather Assets
- [ ] Download icons and other assets as SVGs from Material Design Icons.
- [ ] Choose and include fonts (Roboto or another font of your choice) from Google Fonts.
- [ ] Review how to include external fonts in your project (refer to the "More Text Styles" lesson if needed).

## Step 5: Tips & Finalizing
- [ ] Apply background colors or borders to containers to visualize the grid structure.
- [ ] Choose grid track units (pixels, fr units, or both) based on the layout requirements.
- [ ] Optional: Make the project cards section responsive by adjusting layout on window resize.
- [ ] Focus on practicing CSS and creating your unique design (doesn't have to match the provided design exactly).
- [ ] Push the completed project to GitHub.
- [ ] Use GitHub Pages to publish and share your project.
